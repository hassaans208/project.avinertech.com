# **AvinerTech** Project

Welcome to the **AvinerTech** project! This project is built using **Laravel**, employing a **microservices monolithic architecture**. It's designed to be scalable, maintainable, and easily extendable.

---

## Pre-requisite

It is still underdevelopment, and will become fully scaffolded including setting up Nginx or Apache configurations. A few projects are live.

## **Overview**

**AvinerTech** is a robust application built to support a multi-tenant architecture, with core services and modules that are designed to interact seamlessly. This project utilizes a **single Composer vendor** across all modules, making dependency management and autoloading centralized and efficient.

### **Project Structure**

The project follows a **monolithic architecture** with a focus on microservices. The application is divided into several core components:

* **Core Service (`core.avinertech.com`)**: Contains all essential services, configurations, and business logic that are shared across all tenant applications.
* **Tenant Service (`tenant.avinertech.com`)**: Handles tenant-specific functionality and services. Each tenant can have unique configurations, applications, and customizations.
* **Modules**: Contains reusable modules that can be shared across tenants or core services.

## **Key Features**

* **Microservices Architecture**: The application is designed to scale horizontally, with each module or service encapsulating a specific functionality.
* **Single Composer Vendor**: All services and modules rely on a single Composer vendor, streamlining dependency management.
* **Multi-Tenant Support**: Tenants can have their unique configurations, applications, and services.
* **Flexible Customization**: Custom services and applications can be developed per tenant, ensuring versatility.
* **Development Tools**: Artisan commands and global utilities are defined for streamlining development tasks.

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

* PHP (version 8.1+ recommended)
* Composer
* Laravel
* Node.js and npm (for front-end build tools)
* MySQL or MariaDB (for database management)

### **1. Clone the Repository**

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.avinertech.com.git
cd project.avinertech.com
```

### **2. Install Composer Dependencies**

Install the necessary Composer packages:

```bash
composer install
```

### **3. Install NPM Dependencies**

If your project includes front-end assets, install the necessary Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### **4. Configure Environment File**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust any necessary configurations, such as database connections and environment-specific settings. (seperate for each project)
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### **5. Generate Application Key**

Generate a new application key for Laravel: (seperate for each project)

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### **6. Migrate Database**

Run the database migrations to set up the necessary tables for your application: (seperate for each project)

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### **7. Running the Development Server**

Start the Laravel development server: (seperate for each project)

```bash
php artisan serve
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

## **Development Notes**

* **Core Services**: All shared services, such as user authentication, payment gateway integrations, and more, are defined in `core.avinertech.com`. These services are reusable and can be customized based on tenant-specific needs.

* **Tenant-Specific Services**: Services that are unique to a particular tenant are defined in `tenant.avinertech.com`. Each tenant can override or extend the base functionality from the core service.

* **Composer Vendor**: All shared dependencies (from the core and tenant services) are managed centrally via Composer's `vendor/` directory. This allows for streamlined management of shared libraries across services.
